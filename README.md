# AI-Powered-Email-Agent-using-LangGraph
This project focuses on developing an intelligent Email Agent utilizing LangGraph and large language models to streamline email processing through automation. The agent is capable of recognizing spam, revising email content, and generating context-aware replies, offering a comprehensive solution for efficient email management.

Key Features:
Spam Detection
The system uses a language model-based classifier to analyze incoming emails and determine whether they are spam. This is achieved through prompt-based classification, allowing flexible and accurate detection without the need for a separate machine learning model.

Email Revision
For non-spam emails, the agent can automatically revise the email content, improving grammar, tone, and clarity. This ensures that the email is professional and easy to read before being further processed or replied to.

Reply Generation
Once an email is verified as legitimate and revised, the agent generates a personalized and polite reply using a language model. This reply is context-aware and designed to save the user time while maintaining quality communication.
