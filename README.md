# 📧 AI-Powered Email Agent using LangGraph

This project is an intelligent Email Agent built with LangGraph and large language models (LLMs). It automates email processing by detecting spam, revising email content, and generating professional replies — making email management efficient and seamless.

🚀 Features
1. Spam Detection
Automatically classifies incoming emails as spam or legitimate using LLM-based prompts. No need for separate ML models; flexible and accurate filtering is handled by natural language processing.

2. Email Revision
For legitimate emails, the agent revises the content to correct grammar, adjust tone, and improve clarity. Ensures that all emails are clean, professional, and ready to use.

3. Reply Generation
Generates polite, context-aware replies for non-spam emails, saving you time and maintaining high communication standards.

🛠️ Tech Stack
LangGraph: Manages and orchestrates the multi-step workflow.
OpenAI GPT (or compatible LLMs): Handles spam classification, revision, and reply generation.
Python: Core implementation language.
(Optional) IMAP/SMTP Integration: For real-time email fetching and sending.
